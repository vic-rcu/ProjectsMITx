This Repository contains all the work done in association with the MITx 6.86 Introduction to Machine Learning - From
Linear Models to Deep Learning as presented on the educational platform edx.org. I chose to complete this class after my
 first semester at TUM in order to get started with Machine Learning.

Since the class is not yet over, this repository will be extended by two further projects. The main focus of the
projects was a guided application of the course Material. So far the Repository contains following projects:

1. project0
An introduction into the grading system used by the platform. There is no relevant course work covered here, however it
is included in the repository for completion reasons.

2. sentient_analysis
This project was based on the learned material on Linear Classifiers. I implemented the perceptron and pegasos
algorithms for training linear classification models. These algorithms were then applied to a sentiment analysis of
written text reviews. Additionally, I implemented helper functions to help with the data extraction (bag of words
approach) and classification process. The implemented models were then tested and fine-tuned in the main.py file,
according to the course requirements.
